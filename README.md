<h1>Smart-Classroom-Efficient-Classroom-Management-System</h1>

<p> The Smart Classroom: Efficient Classroom Management System is a C-based application designed to manage and organize class schedules for computer laboratories in a school or university setting. The project aims to eliminate the inefficiencies and potential conflicts of traditional manual scheduling (e.g., using blackboards or paper). It uses file handling in C to store, retrieve, and update class schedules in plain text files and applies logical time conflict detection to prevent double-booking of rooms. Key programming concepts used include structured programming, file I/O, modular programming, string manipulation, and sorting algorithms. </p>
